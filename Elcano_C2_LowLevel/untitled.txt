128Kbytes of memory
32Kbyte page frames
512K virtual address space

Virtual address space is 512K: so it has 19 bits. The size of each page is 32KB. That is, offset bits is 4, and the other 15 bits are page bits.

1.

The CPU demands the data at 0x730CD

0111 0011 0000 1100 1101
 --- -	1110 = E
 
2. 
0, because there's no frame there

physical address:
17 bits: 2 for frame, 15 for offset
